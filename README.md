With Test-Driven Design for Agility

-----

A formal Test-Driven Development (TDD) process allows us to build testing into our daily routine. We can run 
tests many times a day, getting instant feedback on the quality of our code. This aligns very well with the 
iterative and incremental approach of the **Agile methodology**.

The testing approach in TDD is only *unit testing*. That is, testing your code at the smallest unit level. Other 
types of testing, such as *integration testing*, *system testing* or *functional testing*,, test your application 
at a higher level and therefore not part of TDD 's scope.


After identified the **user story** then proceed to test the requirements:

1. Write a failing test case.
2. Code to pass the test.
3. Refactor the code.
