With Test-Driven Design for Agility

-----

A formal test-driven development (TDD) process allows you to build testing into your daily routine. You can run 
tests many times a day, getting instant feedback on the quality of your code. This aligns very well with the 
iterative and incremental approach of the **Agile methodology**.

After identified the **user story** then proceed to test the requirements:

1. Write a failing test case.
2. Code to pass the test.
3. Refactor the code.
